# Surveys

When to use surveys:

* Measure changes over time (such as satisfaction or uptake)
* Quantify characteristics of users
* Measure attitudes or intents
* Measure product usage or activity


__Respondents__

For surveys, it's better to have a significant number of responses.  "Significant" can mean different things depending on how big your target population is (consider the difference between a retail shop with 400 customers that they want to survey and a market research firm trying to gather data on middle-aged Americans).


__Questions__

Determine what type of information you're hoping to get first, and then draft questions that will help you gather these details.
You may want to use multiple choice questions with a provided list of responses (what tools do you use for blogging?).
Or you may want to use questions with a rating scale (how satisfied are you with your blogging platform?).
Or you may want to include open-ended questions (which blogging tool could you not live without?).


__Preparing the Survey__

For online surveys, you may choose to use a tool like Google Forms, Survey Monkey, Wufoo, Typeform, or LimeSurvey.  Once you've drafted a set of survey questions, get feedback from a few friends or colleagues.  They'll let you know if some of the wording seems odd or if the answer options don't seem totally right.

__Tips__

Include demographic questions if you want a general idea of who the respondents are.

Include use or tool questions if you're curious about the tools or products they use.

Keep the survey as short as possible.

If the survey continues onto more than one page, include an indication of progress so that the respondent has some idea of how many questions are left.

Open-ended questions can be handy, but don't ask too many if you're expecting a lot of responses.  They can be harder to analyze.
