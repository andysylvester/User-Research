# Questions for a survey

_(Build a collection of questions to ask in user surveys by taking these starters and customizing the information
to fit what you’re studying.  While interview questions are great when they're open-ended, survey questions are easier to analyze when they're discretely quantifiable.  You may want to include a mix of different types of questions in your survey.  Surveys vary in length and format, but shorter surveys are often preferred by users.)_

When creating questions for your survey, consider:

How can you find out more about who your users are?

How can you find out more about what your users want to accomplish?

How can you find out more about what your users are looking for?
