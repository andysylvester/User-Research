Sample Script for Interviewers
------------------------------

Hi, I’m __[INTERVIEWER NAME]__, and sitting next to me is __[NOTETAKER NAME]__.

Thanks for taking the time to talk with us today!

We’re doing a little research on __[pet gerbils]__, and we want to learn more about the products that __[gerbil owners]__ use when they __[take care of their gerbils]__.

We wanted to have a quick conversation with you today and ask you about your experiences as a __[gerbil owner]__.  Our call shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes.  

Do you mind if we record this call for our notes?  The recording won’t be published or shared outside our team, it just helps us with our notetaking.

_(Wait for confirmation before turning on the recording.  If the participant doesn’t agree to the recording, continue without it.)_

Great!  To get started, could you think back to the last time you __[fed your gerbil]__ and walk through the steps you took?

_(To get started, get the participant to start describing some aspect of how they use whatever you’re studying.  As the interview progresses, draw from your list of prepared probe questions.  Use clarifying questions to gather more details around things they say.  Don’t be afraid to ask about something you haven’t written down if they say something interesting.)_

That’s it for my questions.  Is there anything else that you’d like to add that I haven’t asked you about?

_(Give the participant a chance to respond.)_

Thank you so much for taking the time to have this conversation about __[gerbils]__.  Your input has been very helpful.

I’ll be sending out your __[awesome incentive]__ later today, so check your __[email/mail/where ever it’s going]__.

Thank you again for your time!
