# Interviews

When to use interviews:

* When you're conducting needs finding
* When you want to see how someone works in their environment
* When you want to access the needs, tools, and workflows of your user or target customer
* When you want to gather detailed information on attitudes, desires, and experiences from your user or target customer


__Participants__

* Between 5 and 8 people is a good number to aim for when you're conducting a quick set of interviews
* You may need to recruit from an existing user email list, from social networks, from family and friends, or from other interest groups.
* If you're providing compensation of some sort, things like Amazon gift cards, prepaid debit cards, and Starbucks cards can be sent digitally.
* If you're providing some form of compensation or reward in person, you may consider food (free lunch!), coffee/beverages, company swag, or checks ($$) as options.

__Game Plan__
* Create a screener survey that you can post online or send around. Be sure to gather contact info, and follow up with anyone who you'd like to schedule for an interview.
