# Usability Testing

When should you test?

* Test when it goes from being a project to a product
* Test when you want someone else to use it
* Test when you don't know
* Test when you're building based on assumptions
* Test early and test often

What should you test?

* Test with the questions that you want answered
* Decide what kind of answers you're looking for
* Choose the research methods that will get you closer to the answers you're looking for
