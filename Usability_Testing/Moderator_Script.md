Moderator's script for usability testing
----------------------------------------

Hi, __[participant name]__. My name is __[your name]__, and I'm going to be walking you through the session today.

Before we get started, I just want to go over a little bit of information with you.

You probably already know, but let me explain why we've asked you to participate today. We're testing a website and
product to see what it’s like for web developers to use it.

I want to start by saying that we're testing the website, not you. You can't do or say anything wrong, and nothing is
going to hurt our feelings.

We want to hear exactly what you think so that we can improve the website.

As you use the site, I'm going to ask you to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do,
and what you’re thinking.  This will really help us.

If you have questions, just ask. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we're interested in how people do
when they don't have someone sitting next to them, but I will try to answer any questions you still have when we're
done.

If you need to take a break at any point or you’d like to quite, just let me know.  That’s perfectly ok.

Also, with your permission, I’d like to turn on the recording for the web conference.  The video will only be used by
us internally, and it will really help me with note-taking.

Is it all right if I turn on the conference recording?

__TURN ON RECORDING__

There are also a few other people observing today.  They’re members of the product team, and they’re here to watch and
learn how to make the website better.  They won’t be saying anything during the session, but I may check to see if they
have any questions.

Do you have any questions so far?

Okay, to start, I’d like you to take out the participant guide that I emailed you yesterday.  Do you have it handy?

Okay.  Now I’m going to read you the instructions for today’s session.

__READ INSTRUCTIONS__

__READ PRE-TASK QUESTIONS__

Okay, let’s get started.  I’d like you to read each task out loud, complete the task, and remember to think out loud throughout the process.

Please begin.
