# Moderator's script for usability testing

Hi, __[participant name]__. My name is __[your name]__, and I'm going to be walking you through the session today.

Before we get started, I just want to go over a little bit of information with you.

You probably already know, but let me explain why we've asked you to participate today. We're testing
__[a product type (eg a website)]__ to see what it’s like for __[user type (eg developers)]__ to use it.

I want to start by saying that we're testing __[product]__, not you. You can't do or say anything wrong, and nothing is
going to hurt our feelings.

We want to hear exactly what you think so that we can improve the website.

As you use the site, I'm going to ask you to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do,
and what you’re thinking.  This will really help us.

If you have questions, just ask. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we're interested in how people do
when they don't have someone sitting next to them, but I will try to answer any questions you still have when we're
done.

If you need to take a break at any point or you’d like to quit, just let me know.  That’s perfectly OK.

Also, with your permission, I’d like to record this session.  The video will only be used by us internally, and it will
really help me with note-taking.

Is it all right if I turn on the conference recording?

__TURN ON RECORDING__

__[If other people are in attendance:]__

There are also a few other people observing today.  They’re members of the product team, and they’re here to watch and
learn how to make the website better.  They won’t be saying anything during the session, but I may check to see if they
have any questions.

__[Continue:]__

Do you have any questions so far?

Okay.  Now I’m going to read you the instructions for today’s session.

## Instructions

On the next few pages you’ll find a list of tasks. Approach these tasks as if you were sitting alone at work or home.

As you work, please do the following:

* Read each task out loud before you begin.
* Remember to think out loud.  Talk about what you are thinking, doing, experiencing, and expecting.
* Whenever you have a question or comment, please state it!  You can say anything you want - positive or negative.
* You’re almost ready!  Before we begin, we have a few more questions to start things off.

## Pre-task questions

_A handful of questions that set the context for the user: how they'd describe their role, which products they
currently use, and so on._

## Tasks

_A series of atomic tasks that encourage the user to perform a single action with your product. Each task should have
a number of planned follow-up questions: "where would you look if you wanted to find X?" "How would you describe what
this product / feature does?"_

## Post-task questions

_A handful of questions that summarize the user's experience. For example, what did they like most? What did they
like least? How likely are they to recommend the product to friends or colleagues? If they could change one thing
about the product, what would it be?_

## Conclusion

We're all done. Thank you so much for your time!
